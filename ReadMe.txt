AocTM: Age of Empires II: The Conquerors, Team Manager.

Features:
1. Record games parsers. Especially players' team and winner information detection.
2. Player rating system. Based on GameZone's algorithm but a lot of improvements made to achieve a balance system that any one's rating will be a number in some range whatever the initial rating for him was set, 1500, or 1600.
3. Grouping or Team system. Based on an idea that nobody would win all night and nobody would lose all night, and nobody would win too easily, that the average ratings for all team members are nearly the same for the two teams. Fun for everybody.
4. Record games listing and summary. Store each games you played in a database (sqlite), and you can get a summary for any time sequences that  who earns how many points and who's the best player. Lists, graph and histogram to show.
5. And a lot more for the management of a group of hardcore multiplayer lovers.
